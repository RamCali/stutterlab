---

## App Marketing: Paid & Store Channels

### 1. App Store Optimization (ASO) — Deep Dive

The existing ASO section covers basics. This expands into a full store listing strategy.

**App Name & Subtitle (30-char limit each)**

| Field | Copy |
|-------|------|
| App Name | StutterLab |
| Subtitle | Daily Speech Practice by an SLP |

**Keyword Field (100 characters, commas, no spaces)**

```
stuttering,stutter,speech therapy,fluency,stammering,speech exercises,SLP,speech coach,confidence
```

**Category:** Health & Fitness (primary), Medical (secondary)

**Description structure:**
1. Lead with the problem → "You know what to do. You just don't have time to practice."
2. SLP credibility → "Designed by a licensed speech-language pathologist."
3. Evidence line → "Techniques backed by 25+ peer-reviewed studies (effect sizes d = 0.75–1.63)."
4. Feature bullets → daily practice, technique library, streak tracking, AI coach
5. Social proof → testimonials, rating count
6. CTA → "Start your free trial today."

**Screenshots (first 3 matter most):**

| # | Screen | Caption |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | Daily Practice home | "Your 5-minute daily plan" |
| 2 | Technique exercise in progress | "SLP-designed exercises with evidence ratings" |
| 3 | Streak calendar with a long streak | "Build a daily habit that sticks" |
| 4 | Progress dashboard | "See your confidence grow over time" |
| 5 | AI Coach conversation | "Get real-time advice from your AI speech coach" |

**Ratings & Reviews Strategy:**
- Prompt at positive moments only: 7-day streak, first technique mastered, confidence score increase
- Never prompt during practice or after a bad session
- Reply to every negative review within 48 hours

**Localization priorities:** English (US) → English (UK, use "stammering") → Spanish → Portuguese

### 2. Apple Search Ads (Keywords Only)

Run Search Results campaigns (cost-per-tap). Start narrow, expand based on TTR and CPA.

**Tier 1 — Brand & Exact Intent (highest bid)**

| Keyword | Match Type | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| stutterlab | Exact | Brand defense |
| stuttering app | Exact | Direct intent |
| stutter app | Exact | Variation |
| stammering app | Exact | UK users |
| speech therapy app | Exact | High intent |

**Tier 2 — Condition + Solution (medium bid)**

| Keyword | Match Type | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| stuttering help | Broad | Problem-aware |
| stuttering exercises | Broad | Practice-seeking |
| speech fluency | Broad | Clinical searchers |
| fluency therapy | Broad | SLP-adjacent |
| speech coach | Broad | Coach-seeking |
| stammering exercises | Broad | UK variation |

**Tier 3 — Competitor Conquesting (low bid, test)**

| Keyword | Match Type | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| stamurai | Exact | Direct competitor |
| speech therapy online | Broad | Category capture |
| fluency app | Broad | Category capture |

**Negative keywords:** kids, toddler, preschool, baby, child, autism, apraxia, aphasia, stroke

**Budget:** Start at $20-30/day. Scale keywords with CPA < $5 and TTR > 5%.

**Custom Product Pages:** Create 2-3 variants matching ad groups:
- "Evidence-Based" variant → lead screenshot shows evidence badges
- "Daily Practice" variant → lead screenshot shows streak + daily plan
- "AI Coach" variant → lead screenshot shows coach conversation

---

### 3. YouTube Strategy (Video + Ads)

YouTube is the #1 platform where adults who stutter already consume content (speech therapy tips, personal stories, technique demos). Meet them there.

**Organic Channel Content**

| Series | Format | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Technique Tutorials | 3-5 min, face-to-camera + app demo | Weekly | SEO + trust. "How to use easy onset in a job interview." |
| User Stories | 2-3 min, real user testimonials | Biweekly | Social proof. Show real progress. |
| Evidence Explained | 5-8 min, whiteboard/slide style | Monthly | Differentiator. "What does d = 1.63 actually mean for you?" |
| App Walkthroughs | 1-2 min, screen recording | At launch + major updates | Reduce friction. Show the daily flow. |

**Video SEO:** Title every video with a search query, not a brand name.
- "How to Stop Stuttering in Job Interviews (SLP Technique)" > "StutterLab Tutorial #4"
- Tags: stuttering, speech therapy, fluency, stammering, SLP, speech exercises
- Pin a comment with app link + free trial CTA

**YouTube Ads**

| Campaign Type | Format | Targeting | Goal |
|---------------|--------|-----------|------|
| In-Stream (skippable) | 15-30s, hook in first 5s | Interest: speech therapy, stuttering, health apps; Custom intent: "stuttering app", "speech therapy for adults" | App installs |
| Discovery / In-Feed | Thumbnail + headline | Search: "stuttering tips", "speech therapy exercises"; Placed on competitor/adjacent videos | Channel subs + app installs |
| Shorts Ads | 15s vertical, single technique tip | Broad health & wellness, retargeting site visitors | Awareness + installs |

**Ad Creative Guidelines:**
- Hook (0-5s): Start with the pain point. "Tired of dreading every phone call?"
- Middle (5-20s): Show the app solving it. Screen recording of a daily practice session.
- CTA (last 5s): "Try StutterLab free for 7 days."
- Always feature a real person (not stock). Authenticity matters in this niche.

**Budget:** Start at $30-50/day. Optimize for cost-per-install < $8.

**Paid Sponsorships / Influencer Partnerships**

| Channel | Subscribers | Why It Matters | Deal Type |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| [Speak Your Mind Method](https://www.youtube.com/@speakyourmindmethod) | ~8K | Run by Marcus Lapp (former stutterer & speech mentor). 260K+ views, neuroplasticity-based approach. Highly engaged niche audience of adults actively working on fluency. | Sponsored video or dedicated integration |

- **Why this channel:** The audience is pre-qualified — people already investing time in stuttering content. Sponsoring a video here reaches motivated adults at the exact moment they're seeking solutions.
- **Approach:** Reach out for a dedicated integration (60-90s mid-roll) or a co-created "app review" style video. Offer affiliate/commission on installs to align incentives.
- **Expected CPI:** Niche channels with <50K subs typically deliver $3-6 CPI with proper tracking links — potentially better than broad YouTube ads.

---

### 4. Hard Paywall Strategy

StutterLab uses a **hard paywall with free trial** — no permanent free tier.

**Why hard paywall over freemium:**
- The product is a daily practice tool. Giving away 1 exercise/day fragments the experience and teaches users the app is "limited"
- Hard paywall with a generous trial lets users experience the *full* product and form the habit before paying
- Comparable health apps (Headspace, Calm, Woebot) have proven this model at scale
- Smaller TAM (adults who stutter) means higher ARPU is essential — can't rely on volume-based freemium conversion

**Trial & Pricing Structure**

| Tier | Price | What's Included |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Free Trial | $0 for 7 days | Full access to everything. No credit card required to start. |
| Monthly | $9.99/mo | Full access after trial |
| Annual | $59.99/yr ($5/mo) | Full access, best value. Highlighted as default. |
| Lifetime | $149.99 (future) | Only introduce after annual conversion is healthy |

**Paywall Placement:**
- **First open:** After onboarding (screen 4 of 4), show paywall. User has just set goals and severity — they're invested.
- **Soft dismiss:** User can tap "Start free trial" or "Maybe later." If dismissed, they hit the wall after attempting their first practice session.
- **No access without trial:** After dismissing twice, every core action (practice, AI coach, progress) triggers the paywall. No workaround.

**Paywall Screen Design:**
- Headline: "Your personalized plan is ready."
- Show the user's goals and severity from onboarding reflected back
- 3 bullet value props with checkmarks: "Full technique library", "Daily guided practice", "AI speech coach"
- Social proof line: "Join 1,000+ adults building daily speech confidence" (update number as it grows)
- Annual plan pre-selected with savings badge ("Save 50%")
- Apple/Google Pay button for one-tap subscribe
- Fine print: "Cancel anytime. No charge until trial ends."

**Paywall Optimization:**
- A/B test trial length: 7 days vs 3 days vs 14 days
- A/B test credit card upfront vs no card required
- Track: trial start rate, trial-to-paid conversion, time-to-first-practice during trial
- Target: >60% trial start rate, >15% trial-to-paid conversion

**Reducing churn after conversion:**
- Day 3 of trial: push notification — "You've practiced 3 days in a row. Here's what that means for your fluency."
- Day 5 of trial: in-app message — "Your trial ends in 2 days. Lock in your streak."
- Day 6 of trial: email — "Your progress so far" with stats summary
- Post-conversion month 1: weekly "wins" email with practice stats
- Cancel flow: offer pause (1 month) before full cancellation

## $299/yr Premium Value Stack

Based on a full audit of what's built and what delivers real value, these are the 7 screens that justify $299/yr.

**The pricing logic:** StutterLab is the most comprehensive daily speech practice tool available — SLP-designed, AI-powered, available 24/7, personalized, private. At $0.82/day, it's accessible to anyone serious about building daily practice habits.

**Why $299/yr is plausible:**

| Option | Typical Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| DAF/FAF devices | $2,000-$4,000 one-time |
| Other speech apps | $60-$150/year |
| **StutterLab** | **$299/year** |

| # | Screen | What You Get | Why It Matters |
|---|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | **AI Simulators** | Practice real-world scenarios with adaptive AI | Build confidence for phone calls, interviews, ordering — on your schedule |
| 2 | **Audio Lab** | Real-time DAF, FAF, metronome, choral speaking | Professional-grade audio tools in your pocket — no $4,000 device needed |
| 3 | **Clinical Assessment** | AI-powered %SS scoring + shareable reports | Track your progress with objective, clinical-grade measurements monthly |
| 4 | **Daily Practice** | Adaptive 4-step session personalized to you | The daily habit loop that drives real improvement over time |
| 5 | **Feared Words** | AI-generated graduated exposure content | Systematic practice on the exact words that challenge you most |
| 6 | **Shadowing** | Echo clips + AI scoring on rhythm and technique | Proven method (90%+ fluency improvement in research), gamified |
| 7 | **Progress + Reports** | Trend charts, heatmap, personalization insights | See proof that your daily practice is working — and share it |

### Why These 7 and Not the Others

**Cut from nav:** Community, Mindset/CBT, Settings, Techniques library. These are supporting features — they live *inside* the app but don't need their own tab. Community becomes a feed inside Home. CBT becomes part of Daily Practice. Techniques become reference cards inside practice flows.

**The 7-screen mobile nav:**

```
Bottom tabs (5):  Home  |  Practice  |  Audio Lab  |  Assess  |  Progress
Top-level pages:  AI Simulators (from Home CTA)
                  Feared Words (from Home CTA)
                  Shadowing (from Practice hub)
```

### What Makes Each Screen Worth Paying For

**1. AI Simulators** — The strongest feature. Claude adapts to the user's feared situations from onboarding, adjusts tone based on real-time speech metrics, never breaks character. 9 scenarios (phone calls, interviews, ordering food). This is the feature people *tell their friends about*.

**2. Audio Lab** — The moat. Real-time DAF (20-300ms), FAF (-12 to +12 semitones), metronome, choral speaking — all running live via Web Audio API. A SpeechEasy device costs $4,000. StutterLab puts the same evidence-based tools in your browser for $299/yr.

**3. Clinical Assessment** — AI-powered %SS scoring from a standardized reading passage. Generates severity rating, stutter fingerprint, personalized recommendations, and a shareable PDF report. Objective measurement you can track month over month.

**4. Daily Practice** — The 4-step adaptive session (Breathe → Technique → Speak → Reflect). The personalization engine learns which techniques work best for each user and adjusts the curriculum. This is the daily habit that drives retention.

**5. Feared Words** — AI generates graduated content for each word (phrases → sentences → paragraphs) at 3 difficulty levels. Systematic desensitization — the clinical gold standard for exposure — automated and personalized.

**6. Shadowing** — Echo clips with recording + AI scoring (rhythm match, technique accuracy, pace). Shadowing/choral speech produces 90%+ fluency improvement in research. Gamified with stars and XP.

**7. Progress + Reports** — Fluency trend chart, practice heatmap, personalization insights (Fluency Shaping vs. Modification weighting), session history, and the monthly clinical report hub. This is the "proof it's working" screen that prevents churn at renewal time.

### The $299/yr Paywall Pitch

> **"SLP-designed. AI-powered. Available 24/7.**
> Daily practice, real-time audio tools, monthly assessments, and a curriculum that adapts to you — for **$0.82/day**."

StutterLab complements professional care — it's the daily practice companion that helps you build skills between sessions, on your own time, at your own pace.
