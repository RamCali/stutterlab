## Why Daily Practice Matters

Stuttering therapy works best when you practice consistently — not just during your weekly SLP session. Research shows that **daily practice of 20-30 minutes** produces significantly better outcomes than sporadic longer sessions.

Here are 8 evidence-based exercises you can start today.

## Beginner Exercises

### 1. Diaphragmatic Breathing (3 minutes)

Fluent speech starts with proper breath support. Most people who stutter tend to hold tension in their chest and throat.

**How to practice:**
- Sit comfortably with one hand on your chest, one on your belly
- Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts — your belly should rise, not your chest
- Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 counts
- Repeat 5-10 times before speaking practice

This becomes your warm-up before every session.

### 2. Gentle Onset (5 minutes)

Instead of forcing sounds out, start each phrase with a soft, easy voice. Think of turning a dimmer switch rather than flipping a light switch.

**How to practice:**
- Start with vowels: "ah... apple", "oh... open"
- Progress to consonants: "mmm... morning", "nnn... nice"
- Then phrases: "I would like...", "Can you help me..."
- Keep your throat relaxed — if you feel tension, start softer

### 3. Prolonged Speech (5 minutes)

Stretch your words slightly, connecting them smoothly like a gentle stream rather than choppy rapids.

**How to practice:**
- Read a passage at half your normal speed
- Stretch vowel sounds: "Toooodaaay iiis aaa gooood daaay"
- Gradually increase speed while keeping connections smooth
- The goal isn't slow speech forever — it's training smooth connections

## Intermediate Exercises

### 4. Light Articulatory Contact (5 minutes)

When you form consonants like /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, touch your tongue, lips, and teeth as lightly as possible. Heavy contact creates the tension that triggers blocks.

**How to practice:**
- Say words starting with pressure consonants: "paper", "bottle", "table"
- Focus on the lightest possible touch
- If you feel any tension, start the word over with less pressure

### 5. DAF Practice (10 minutes)

Delayed Auditory Feedback — hearing your voice on a slight delay — naturally slows your speech rate and has been shown to reduce stuttering by up to 80%.

**How to practice:**
- Use StutterLab's Audio Lab or any DAF tool
- Start with a 100-120ms delay
- Read passages aloud, letting the delay guide your pace
- As fluency improves, gradually reduce the delay

## Advanced Exercises

### 6. Cancellation

After you stutter on a word, **stop**, pause, and say the word again using your technique.

**How to practice:**
- Read aloud or have a conversation
- When you stutter, stop mid-sentence
- Take a breath
- Say the stuttered word again with gentle onset or prolongation
- Continue the sentence

This builds awareness and replaces old patterns with new ones.

### 7. Pull-Out

Instead of pushing through a block, **ease out** of it while it's happening.

**How to practice:**
- When you feel stuck on a sound, don't force it
- Slow down mid-word and stretch the sound gently
- Transition smoothly to the next sound
- This takes practice — start in low-pressure situations

### 8. Voluntary Stuttering

This might seem counterintuitive, but deliberately stuttering on **non-feared** words reduces fear and builds a sense of control.

**How to practice:**
- Choose easy words and deliberately repeat the first sound 2-3 times
- "I-I-I would like a coffee"
- Practice in comfortable situations first
- Gradually try it in more challenging contexts

## Putting It Together: A Daily Session

Here's a sample 25-minute daily practice:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 2 min | Diaphragmatic breathing |
| 5 min | Gentle onset + prolonged speech |
| 10 min | DAF reading practice |
| 5 min | Conversation practice (with AI or a partner) |
| 3 min | Voice journal reflection |

## Key Principles

- **Consistency beats intensity**: 25 minutes daily > 2 hours once a week
- **Start easy**: Master beginner exercises before moving to advanced
- **Track progress**: Measure fluency objectively over time
- **Be patient**: Real improvement happens over weeks and months
- **Work with an SLP**: These exercises complement professional treatment
