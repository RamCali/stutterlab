## Why Home Practice Is Essential

Research consistently shows that **the biggest predictor of stuttering training success is how much a person practices between sessions**. Your weekly SLP session teaches you what to do — home practice is where you actually build the skills.

Think of it like learning an instrument. A 30-minute lesson teaches you the techniques, but the daily practice is what makes you a musician.

## Setting Up Your Practice Space

You don't need a clinic-quality setup. Here's what helps:

- **A quiet room** where you won't be interrupted
- **A device with a microphone** (laptop, tablet, or phone)
- **Headphones** (essential for auditory feedback exercises)
- **A timer** for structured sessions
- **A journal or app** for tracking progress

## Daily Home Routine for Adults

### Morning Warm-Up (5 minutes)

Start your day with breathing and gentle onset:

1. **2 minutes** of diaphragmatic breathing
2. **3 minutes** of gentle onset practice with everyday phrases ("Good morning", "I'd like coffee", "What's the plan today?")

### Main Practice Session (20 minutes)

Choose your focus for the day:

**Technique Days (Mon, Wed, Fri)**
- 10 min: Audio Lab with DAF/FAF
- 5 min: Reading practice using your target technique
- 5 min: Spontaneous speech practice

**Conversation Days (Tue, Thu)**
- 10 min: AI conversation practice (phone calls, social scenarios)
- 5 min: Feared word practice
- 5 min: Real-world challenge (make an actual phone call or talk to someone)

**Reflection Days (Sat, Sun)**
- 10 min: Voice journal — record your thoughts about your week
- 10 min: Review your progress data, set goals for next week

## Home Practice for Children

Kids need shorter, more playful practice:

### Ages 2-6 (10-15 minutes)

- **Turtle talk**: Speak slowly like a turtle — make it a game
- **Breathing bubbles**: Blow bubbles while practicing slow exhales
- **Easy starts**: Practice starting words softly with favorite toys
- **Reading together**: Read picture books using gentle, slow speech
- **Praise fluency**: "I loved how smooth that sounded!"

> **Important**: For young children, the Lidcombe Program is the most evidence-based approach. It's parent-delivered — your SLP trains you to run the sessions at home.

### Ages 7-12 (15-20 minutes)

- Reading aloud with DAF support
- Gentle onset practice with school vocabulary
- Role-playing phone calls and classroom participation
- Simple voice journaling about their day
- Tracking streaks for daily practice (kids love this)

## Tips for Staying Consistent

1. **Same time every day** — attach it to an existing habit (after morning coffee, before bed)
2. **Start small** — 10 minutes is better than skipping 30 minutes
3. **Track your streak** — visual progress is motivating
4. **Celebrate small wins** — smoother speech in a meeting? That counts
5. **Don't aim for perfection** — aim for progress
6. **Tell someone** — accountability helps (partner, friend, SLP)

## When Home Practice Isn't Enough

See your SLP if:

- You're not sure which exercises to prioritize
- You feel stuck or plateaued
- Speaking anxiety is increasing despite practice
- Your child's stuttering is getting worse
- You need a professional assessment or updated treatment plan

Home practice is powerful, but it works best **alongside professional SLP care**.
