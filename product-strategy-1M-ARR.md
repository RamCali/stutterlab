# StutterLab: $1M ARR Product Strategy

> Target: Adults who stutter (18+) | AI-powered | Evidence-based | Community-driven
>
> **Founded by a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP)** -- this is the unfair advantage.

---

## The Opportunity

**~3 million adults stutter in the US alone** (~1% of the population). Globally, ~70 million people stutter. There is no dominant consumer app in this space.

The faith/wellness app category has proven the playbook:
- Pray.com: $50M+ revenue
- Blessed: 99K reviews, 4.9 stars
- Bible Chat: 301K reviews, 4.9 stars
- Headspace/Calm: $100M+ (meditation parallel)

These apps monetize a **daily habit** around a deeply personal, emotional need. Stuttering is exactly that -- personal, emotional, daily. The playbook transfers directly.

### The SLP Founder Advantage

StutterLab is **created by a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist** -- not a tech founder who Googled stuttering, not a VC-backed team that hired a clinical advisor as an afterthought.

This is the single most important trust signal the app can have:
- **Headspace** was founded by a meditation monk → instant credibility
- **Calm** was founded by tech guys → took years to build trust
- **StutterLab** is founded by the clinician who treats this → day-one authority

Every screen, every exercise, every AI response carries the weight of: "An SLP designed this for you."

## $1M ARR Math

### Conservative Model
| Metric | Number |
|---|---|
| Monthly active users (MAU) | 50,000 |
| Free-to-paid conversion | 5% |
| Paying subscribers | 2,500 |
| Average revenue per user (ARPU) | $33/mo blended |
| Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) | $82,500 |
| **Annual recurring revenue (ARR)** | **$990,000** |

### Blended ARPU breakdown
| Tier | % of Paid | Price | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weekly ($6.99/wk = $30/mo) | 20% | $30/mo | $6.00 |
| Monthly ($12.99/mo) | 30% | $13/mo | $3.90 |
| Annual ($59.99/yr = $5/mo) | 40% | $5/mo | $2.00 |
| Lifetime ($149.99 amortized 24mo) | 10% | $6.25/mo | $0.63 |
| **Blended ARPU** | | | **$12.53/mo** |

### Adjusted model at $12.53 ARPU
| Metric | Number |
|---|---|
| Paying subscribers needed | 6,650 |
| At 5% conversion → MAU needed | 133,000 |
| At 8% conversion (engaged niche) → MAU needed | **83,000** |

**Reality check:** 83K MAU out of 3M US adult stutterers = **2.8% market penetration.** Achievable.

## The 7 Core Features That Drive Revenue

Pulled from what's working across Blessed, Haven, Bible Chat, Bible Path, and Pray.com -- mapped to stuttering.

### 1. AI Speech Coach (The Retention Engine)

**What it does:** Conversational AI trained on evidence-based stuttering techniques, **designed and supervised by an SLP**. Users can ask anything, get personalized guidance, practice scenarios, and receive encouragement.

**Why it prints money:** Every top faith app has an AI chat feature. It's the #1 driver of daily engagement. Users come back to talk to the AI even when they skip structured exercises.

**The SLP edge:** The AI system prompt is written by the founder SLP. This means clinically accurate responses from day one -- not generic wellness platitudes. Every response pattern, technique instruction, and emotional support script is SLP-authored. The AI is an extension of real clinical expertise, not a replacement for it.

**Evidence-based foundation:**
- Speech restructuring techniques (Cohen's d = 0.75-1.63) -- teach gentle onset, prolonged speech, light contacts
- ACT-based responses (from MIST and fACTS programs) -- acceptance, cognitive defusion, values-based living
- Stuttering modification (Cohen's d = 0.56-0.65) -- voluntary stuttering, cancellations, pull-outs

**Key behaviors:**
- Situational coaching: "I have a presentation tomorrow" → tailored prep plan
- Technique reminders: Explains and demos any technique on demand
- Emotional support: ACT-informed responses to shame, avoidance, frustration
- Mock conversations: Practice ordering food, phone calls, job interviews
- Always ends with an actionable next step (learned from Haven)
- Never claims to replace in-person therapy -- refers to professional help when appropriate
- Every response footnotes: "Designed by an SLP. Not a substitute for individualized therapy."

**Monetization:** Free = 3 messages/day. Premium = unlimited.

### 2. Daily Practice Ritual (The Habit Loop)

**What it does:** 4 structured steps each day, taking ~10-15 minutes total.

**Why it prints money:** Blessed proved that a simple daily ritual drives 4.9-star retention. Users build identity around the streak ("I'm on Day 47"). The ritual becomes non-negotiable.

**The 4 Steps:**

| Step | What | Time | Evidence Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Morning Check-In | Rate anxiety, set speaking intention for the day | 1 min | ACT: psychological flexibility, mindful awareness |
| Technique Practice | Audio-guided exercise (rotates daily) | 5-7 min | Speech restructuring (d=0.75-1.63): gentle onset, prolonged speech, light contacts, continuous phonation |
| Real-World Challenge | One specific speaking task with coaching tips | Varies | Behavioral activation, exposure hierarchy (ACT/CBT) |
| Evening Reflection | Log what happened, rate the day, celebrate wins | 2 min | ACT: self-compassion, defusion from negative self-talk |

**Monetization:** Free = Step 1 only. Premium = all 4 steps.

### 3. Panic Button (The Trust Builder)

**What it does:** Instant-access calming tool for moments of stuttering blocks or speech anxiety. Accessible via floating button, shake gesture, or widget.

**Why it prints money:** Bible Chat's Panic Button is one of its most-loved features. For stuttering, this is 10x more critical -- users face real-time speech crises daily. The app that helps them in the moment earns permanent loyalty.

**Panic Button flow:**
1. **Breathe** -- 4-7-8 breathing animation (4s in, 7s hold, 8s out)
2. **Ground** -- Quick ACT defusion exercise ("I'm noticing I'm having the thought that I can't speak")
3. **Reset** -- Choose a technique: gentle onset, voluntary stutter, or pause-and-restart
4. **Go** -- Affirming message + option to log the moment for later reflection

**Evidence basis:** ACT-based psychological interventions show moderate to very large effect sizes when combined with speech modification (MIST program).

**Monetization:** Always free. This is the trust builder that converts free users to paid.

### 4. Streak & Gamification (The Retention Hook)

**What it does:** Tracks consecutive days of practice. Milestones at 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days. Weekly progress rings. Monthly reports.

**Why it prints money:** Streaks are the single strongest retention mechanic across all 5 reference apps. Once a user hits Day 14, churn drops dramatically. The streak becomes a psychological contract.

**StutterLab-specific gamification:**
- **Practice streaks** -- consecutive days completing at least 1 step
- **Challenge badges** -- "Made a phone call," "Ordered at a restaurant," "Spoke up in a meeting"
- **Technique mastery** -- progress bars for each technique learned
- **Confidence score** -- self-reported trend line (shows improvement over weeks/months)
- **Monthly speaking report** -- shareable summary of progress

**Monetization:** Basic streak = free. Detailed analytics, badges, monthly reports = premium.

### 5. Community (The Moat)

**What it does:** Anonymous feed where users share wins, challenges, and encouragement. No DMs (reduces moderation burden). Upvote-only (no downvotes).

**Why it prints money:** Stuttering is isolating. Most adults who stutter have never met another person who stutters. Community creates belonging that no other feature can. Users who engage in community have 3-5x higher retention.

**Community features:**
- **Wins feed** -- "I gave a toast at my friend's wedding" (upvotes + cheers)
- **Challenge of the week** -- community-wide speaking challenge with participation count
- **Anonymous posting** -- reduce shame barrier
- **Encouragement cards** -- send a pre-designed card to someone (Bible Chat's "Send a Blessing")
- **SLP Office Hours** -- weekly or biweekly live Q&A with the founder SLP (premium). This is a massive retention lever. Users feel they have direct access to a real clinician. No other app does this.

**Monetization:** Read = free. Post + interact = premium.

### 6. Widgets & Passive Engagement (The Reminder System)

**What it does:** Home screen and lock screen widgets that rotate content throughout the day.

**Why it prints money:** Bible Path and Bible Chat prove that widgets drive re-engagement without push notification fatigue. The app stays visible on the home screen. Users see it 50+ times/day passively.

**Widget content rotation:**
- **7 AM:** "Good morning. Today's focus: Light contacts on /p/, /b/, /t/ sounds"
- **12 PM:** "Midday challenge: Call someone instead of texting"
- **3 PM:** "Did you know? James Earl Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, and Ed Sheeran all stutter"
- **8 PM:** "Evening reflection: What speaking moment are you proud of today?"
- **Streak widget:** Always showing current streak count

**Monetization:** 1 basic widget = free. Custom widgets + hourly rotation = premium.

### 7. Audio-Guided Exercises (The Practice Content)

**What it does:** SLP-designed and narrated technique exercises users follow along with. 3-7 minutes each. New content weekly.

**Why it prints money:** Pray.com and Bible Path prove audio content drives daily engagement (especially bedtime/morning routines). For stuttering, audio is the natural medium -- users need to *hear* the technique, not read about it.

**The SLP edge:** The founder can record exercises themselves or direct the recordings. "Guided by an SLP" on every exercise is a trust signal no competitor can match. Users know the pacing, the cues, and the progressions are designed by someone who has actually treated stuttering in clinic.

**Exercise library (evidence-based):**

| Technique | Evidence | Exercise Type |
|---|---|---|
| Gentle onset | Speech restructuring (d=0.75-1.63) | Audio: Practice starting words with soft voice onset on progressively harder words |
| Prolonged speech | Speech restructuring (d=0.75-1.63) | Audio: Stretch syllables while maintaining naturalness, guided pacing |
| Light contacts | Speech restructuring (d=0.75-1.63) | Audio: Practice loose, easy articulatory contacts on hard sounds |
| Continuous phonation | Speech restructuring (d=0.75-1.63) | Audio: Connect words with continuous airflow, reducing hard stops |
| Voluntary stuttering | Stuttering modification (d=0.56-0.65) | Audio: Intentionally stutter on non-feared words to reduce fear response |
| Cancellations | Stuttering modification (d=0.56-0.65) | Audio: Stop after a stutter, pause, and re-say the word with technique |
| Pull-outs | Stuttering modification (d=0.56-0.65) | Audio: Modify a stutter mid-block, easing out smoothly |
| ACT defusion | MIST/fACTS (moderate-very large effects) | Audio: Mindfulness exercises for unhooking from stuttering-related thoughts |
| Values clarification | MIST/fACTS (moderate-very large effects) | Audio: Guided reflection on what matters beyond fluency |
| Acceptance practice | MIST/fACTS (moderate-very large effects) | Audio: Making room for stuttering without fighting it |

**Monetization:** 1 exercise/day = free. Full library + new weekly content = premium.

## Pricing Strategy

### Paywall Trigger
Show paywall after the user completes their **first daily check-in** (Step 1). They've invested effort. They've seen the experience. Now show them what's behind the gate.

> "You just completed your first check-in. Unlock the full daily practice to keep building momentum."

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | Target User | Conversion Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free | $0 | Everyone | Step 1 + 3 AI messages + 1 exercise + community read |
| Weekly | $6.99/wk | Impulse/trial | 3-day free trial, auto-converts to weekly |
| Monthly | $12.99/mo | Committed but cautious | "Most popular" badge |
| Annual | $59.99/yr ($5/mo) | Long-term committed | "Best value" badge, 54% savings vs monthly |
| Lifetime | $149.99 | Subscription-fatigued | Added in Phase 3 |

### Revenue optimization (from reference apps)
- **Default to annual** on paywall (Bible Chat and Pray.com do this)
- **7-day free trial** on weekly to hook users before they forget
- **Price anchoring:** Show weekly price first ($6.99/wk = $364/yr), then annual ($59.99/yr) looks like a steal
- **Seasonal promotions:** January (New Year resolutions), May (Better Speech & Hearing Month), September (back to work)

## User Acquisition Channels

### Organic (Primary -- these apps all grow organically)
| Channel | Tactic |
|---|---|
| App Store Optimization (ASO) | Keywords: "stuttering app," "speech therapy," "fluency," "stutter help," "SLP app" |
| Content/SEO | stutterlab.com/blog: "Best exercises for stuttering," "How to stop stuttering," "Famous people who stutter" -- all bylined by the founder SLP |
| TikTok/Reels | **Founder SLP on camera** -- technique demos, myth-busting, "things people who stutter relate to." SLP credentials in bio = instant authority. This is the #1 growth channel. |
| YouTube | SLP-hosted technique tutorials, "day in the life of an SLP building an app," evidence explainers |
| Reddit | r/Stutter (38K members), r/SLP, r/SpeechTherapy -- genuine community participation as a real SLP |
| Stuttering Foundation / NSA | Partnership/endorsement -- SLP credentials open these doors |
| ASHA conferences | Demo at ASHA Convention (15K+ SLPs attend). Other SLPs become referral channels |
| SLP network referrals | Fellow SLPs recommend to their stuttering clients. **Free SLP accounts** so they can preview and trust the content before referring |
| Word of mouth | Shareable progress reports, encouragement cards |
| Podcast guest appearances | Appear on SLP podcasts (SLP Now, Speechie Side Up, etc.) and stuttering podcasts as a clinical expert |

### The SLP-to-SLP Referral Flywheel
```
Founder SLP creates clinically excellent app
        ↓
Fellow SLPs trust it (one of their own made it)
        ↓
SLPs recommend to their stuttering clients
        ↓
Clients use app between therapy sessions
        ↓
Clients improve faster → SLPs see results
        ↓
SLPs recommend to MORE clients
        ↓
Word spreads through SLP community (ASHA, FB groups, grad programs)
        ↓
StutterLab becomes "the app SLPs recommend"
```

This flywheel is impossible to replicate if you're not an SLP. It's the moat.

### Paid (Phase 3)
| Channel | Tactic |
|---|---|
| Apple Search Ads | Bid on "stuttering," "speech therapy app," "fluency" |
| Meta Ads | Target speech therapy interests, SLP groups, stuttering support groups |
| Podcast sponsorships | Speech therapy, self-improvement, anxiety podcasts |
| ASHA/SLP continuing education | Sponsor CE events, offer the app as a clinical tool |

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct competitors (stuttering-specific apps)
| App | Gap StutterLab Fills |
|---|---|
| Stamurai | Technique-only, no AI, no community, dated UI |
| DAF/SpeechEasy apps | Hardware-focused (delayed auditory feedback), no coaching |
| Generic speech therapy apps | Not stuttering-specific, too broad |

### Why nobody has won this market yet
1. **Built by clinicians, not product people** -- great science, terrible UX
2. **Built by tech people, not clinicians** -- great UX, questionable science
3. **No daily habit loop** -- one-time tools, not daily companions
4. **No community** -- isolating experience in an already isolating condition
5. **No AI** -- static content that doesn't adapt to the user
6. **No modern design** -- clinical, sterile, anxiety-inducing UIs

**StutterLab's edge:** The founder is BOTH -- an SLP who understands the clinical science AND is building with a modern consumer app playbook. This combination doesn't exist in the market.

| Competitor Archetype | Clinical Cred | Product/UX | AI | Community | StutterLab |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stamurai (clinician-built) | Strong | Weak | No | No | -- |
| Generic wellness apps | Weak | Strong | Some | Some | -- |
| DAF/hardware tools | Moderate | None (hardware) | No | No | -- |
| **StutterLab** | **SLP-founded** | **4.9-star playbook** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **All of it** |

## Key Metrics to Track

### North Star Metric
**Daily Active Practitioners (DAP):** Users who complete at least 1 daily step.

### Funnel Metrics
| Stage | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Acquisition | App installs/week | 2,000+ |
| Activation | Complete onboarding + first check-in | 60% of installs |

## Domain & URL Architecture

| URL | Purpose | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| **stutterlab.com** | Marketing landing page, blog/SEO, pricing | Next.js (marketing route group) |
| **app.stutterlab.com** | Web app (dashboard, practice, community, coach) | Next.js (app route group) |
| **stutterlab.com/blog** | SEO content hub (bylined by founder SLP) | Next.js (marketing route group) |

### Why subdomain for the app
- Clean separation: marketing site is public/SEO-optimized, app is authenticated
- Independent deployments: landing page can ship without touching the app
- Professional perception: `app.stutterlab.com` signals a real product
- Cookie isolation: auth cookies scoped to `app.stutterlab.com` only

### DNS & Hosting Setup
```
stutterlab.com          → Vercel (marketing site)
app.stutterlab.com      → Vercel (web app) -- same Next.js project, different deployment target
                           OR separate Next.js project if complexity grows
```

### Other domains to secure
- `stutteringlab.com` → redirect to `stutterlab.com` (SEO keyword capture)
- `getstutterlab.com` → redirect (common "get" pattern for app downloads)
- `stutterlab.app` → redirect (if available, .app TLD is clean)

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript | Already set up; SSR for SEO (landing), RSC for app |
| Styling | Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui | Already set up; rapid UI with design system |
| Database | Neon.tech (Postgres) + Drizzle ORM | Already set up; serverless Postgres, type-safe queries |
| AI | Claude API (Anthropic) | Best for nuanced, empathetic conversation; system prompts encode clinical guidelines |
| Audio | Pre-recorded + ElevenLabs for dynamic | Professional voice for exercises, AI-generated for personalized content |
| Auth | NextAuth.js / Auth.js | Email magic link + OAuth; works with subdomain setup |
| Analytics | Mixpanel or PostHog | Funnel tracking, cohort analysis (PostHog is open-source + cheaper) |
| Payments | Stripe + RevenueCat (for future mobile) | Stripe for web subscriptions now; RevenueCat when iOS/Android ship |
| Push | OneSignal or web push via Next.js | Smart notification scheduling |
| Hosting | Vercel | Native Next.js hosting, edge functions, easy subdomain config |
| Widgets | Future: Native (WidgetKit iOS / Glance Android) | Must be native for home/lock screen -- Phase 2 with mobile app |

### Architecture note
The project already uses Next.js App Router with route groups: `(marketing)`, `(auth)`, `(app)`, `(slp)`. For the subdomain split:
- `stutterlab.com` serves `(marketing)` routes
- `app.stutterlab.com` serves `(app)`, `(auth)`, and `(slp)` routes
- Vercel supports this via `vercel.json` rewrites or middleware-based routing

## What Makes This a $1M App vs. a $100K App

| $100K app (most stuttering apps) | $1M app (StutterLab) |
|---|---|
| "Made by developers" | **"Created by an SLP"** |
| Tool you open when you remember | Daily companion you can't skip |
| Static exercises | AI that knows your journey |
| Use alone | Community that gets you |
| One-size-fits-all | Personalized to your fears, goals, severity |
| Clinical and sterile | Warm, modern, calming |
| "Here are some techniques" | "Let's practice for your meeting tomorrow" |
| Users leave after learning techniques | Users stay for streaks, community, coach |
| No emotional connection | Panic Button saved them in a real moment |
| Text-only | Audio-guided, widget-present, always there |
| No clinical authority | SLP founder on TikTok, in the community, doing live Q&As |
| Sells features | Sells transformation: "I went from avoiding phone calls to leading meetings" |

---

## SLP Trust Signals: Where to Surface "Created by an SLP"

The founder being an SLP should be visible everywhere -- not once, everywhere. This is the Headspace "created by a Buddhist monk" playbook.

### In-App Placements
| Location | How |
|---|---|
| App Store subtitle | "Created by an SLP. Backed by research." |
| App Store first screenshot | Founder photo + "Designed by a Speech-Language Pathologist" |
| Onboarding screen 1 | "Hi, I'm [Name], a licensed SLP. I built StutterLab because..." (30-second personal story) |
| Settings / About | Founder bio, credentials (CCC-SLP), clinical philosophy |
| AI Coach intro message | "I'm your AI Speech Coach, designed by [Name], CCC-SLP. How can I help?" |
| Every audio exercise | "Guided by [Name], CCC-SLP" in the exercise card |
| Community | Founder posts weekly, badged as "SLP / Creator" |
| Paywall screen | "Every exercise reviewed by a licensed SLP" |
| Loading screens | Rotating SLP tips: "SLP Tip: Pausing isn't a sign of weakness -- it's a technique" |
| Push notifications | Occasional: "Your SLP tip of the day..." |

### External Placements
| Location | How |
|---|---|
| App Store description | First line: "Created by a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist" |
| stutterlab.com hero | Founder photo, credentials, "I built this because I saw my clients needed more than weekly sessions" |
| TikTok/Reels bio | "[Name], CCC-SLP | stutterlab.com" |
| Press/PR | "SLP-founded app" angle -- unique story for tech + health media |
| SLP conferences | Founder presenting, demoing, networking as a peer |
| App Store "Developer Story" | Personal narrative about why an SLP built an app |

### Why This Matters for Conversion
- **Trust shortcut:** Users don't need to evaluate if the content is legit. An SLP made it. Done.
- **Premium justification:** "You're not paying for an app -- you're getting SLP-designed exercises and AI coaching for $5/mo instead of $150/session."
- **Referral unlock:** Other SLPs will recommend it because one of their own built it. They won't recommend random tech apps.
- **Review quality:** Early reviews will mention "made by an SLP" -- this becomes self-reinforcing social proof.
- **Media hook:** "SLP builds AI app for stuttering" is a story. "Tech company makes stuttering app" is not.
