# StutterLab Messaging Strategy

## Core Insight

Adults who stutter don't search for "speech therapy app." They want:

- **Confidence** — stop second-guessing every word
- **Career** — speak up in meetings, nail interviews
- **Dating** — be yourself without fear
- **Phone calls** — stop avoiding them
- **Social life** — order food, make small talk, introduce yourself

## Messaging Angle

Sell the outcome, not the tool. Lead with the pain point, follow with the solution.

## Ad Hook Examples

- "Stop avoiding phone calls."
- "Speak without fear at work."
- "Fluency training for adults."
- "Your stutter doesn't define your career."
- "Practice the conversations that scare you."
- "What would you say if stuttering wasn't in the way?"

## Landing Page Headlines (Outcome-First)

| Instead of... | Use... |

| AI stuttering therapy app | Speak with confidence in every conversation |
| DAF + FAF audio tools | Stop dreading phone calls |
| 90-day curriculum | From avoiding to owning every room |
| AI speech analysis | See your progress, not just feel it |

## Target Emotional Triggers

1. **Avoidance** — "How many calls have you let go to voicemail?"
2. **Career ceiling** — "Your ideas deserve to be heard in that meeting."
3. **Social isolation** — "Order what you actually want, not what's easy to say."
4. **Dating anxiety** — "First dates shouldn't start with dread."
5. **Self-worth** — "You're not broken. You just need the right practice."
