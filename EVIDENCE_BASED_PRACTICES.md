# Evidence-Based Practices for Stuttering Treatment

> **Purpose:** Reference for app onboarding — show users which treatments are backed by evidence, organized by age group.

## Treatment Efficacy Table (Ranked by Strength of Evidence)

| Rank | Treatment | Age Group | Evidence | Key Outcomes |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Lidcombe Program** | Preschool (2-6) | **High** | Best evidence for preschoolers; d = 0.72-1.00; lower stuttering frequency vs. wait-list; parent-delivered with clinician guidance |
| 2 | **Speech Restructuring / Fluency Shaping** | Adolescents & Adults | **High** | d = 0.75-1.63; significant reduction in stuttering severity and overt characteristics |
| 3 | **Indirect Treatment (RESTART-DCM)** | Preschool (2-6) | **High** | Comparable outcomes to Lidcombe at 18 months; modifies environmental demands/capacities |
| 4 | **Holistic/Multidimensional (ACT/CBT)** | Adolescents & Adults | **Moderate** | Improves both speech fluency AND psychosocial outcomes (quality of life, anxiety, self-efficacy); individualized |
| 5 | **Stuttering Modification (Van Riper)** | Adolescents & Adults | **Moderate** | d = 0.56-0.65; may not address covert stuttering behaviors as effectively |
| 6 | **Mini-KIDS & SCBT** | Preschool (2-6) | **Moderate** | Being tested in TreatPaCS non-inferiority trial against Lidcombe |
| 7 | **Combined Restructuring + Modification** | Adolescents & Adults | **Moderate** | Weak evidence; may offer benefits but less well-studied than individual approaches |
| 8 | **Pharmacological** | All ages | **Low** | No definitive benefit; newer antipsychotics show some promise; atomoxetine + speech therapy limited evidence |
| 9 | **Dietary Treatments** | All ages | **Low** | Insufficient evidence for copper, thiamine, green tea, or Ayurvedic supplements |
| 10 | **Other (rhythmic speaking, breathing, hypnosis)** | All ages | **Low** | Not supported as sole or main treatment |

### Key Gaps in Evidence

- **School-age children (6-12):** Minimal high-quality evidence for ANY specific treatment — significant gap in the literature
- **Long-term outcomes:** Follow-up data beyond 18 months are limited for most interventions
- **Digital interventions:** No robust peer-reviewed evidence for app-based stuttering treatment specifically
- **Holistic approaches:** Integrated methods (ACT + speech) show promise for broader stuttering impact, but sample sizes remain small

## Preschool Children (Ages 2-6)

| Practice | Evidence Level | Effect Size | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Lidcombe Program | Strong | d = 0.72-1.00 | Parent-delivered, clinician-guided; 1-2 year program |
| Indirect therapy (demands & capacities) | Strong | — | Modify environment rather than child's speech directly |
| Early intervention (general) | Strong | — | Brain plasticity highest in this window |

## School-Age Children (Ages 6-12)

| Practice | Evidence Level | Effect Size | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Speech therapy + atomoxetine | Limited | — | One study; needs further investigation |
| No specific treatment has strong evidence | — | — | Gap in the research |

## Adolescents and Adults

| Practice | Evidence Level | Effect Size | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Speech restructuring (fluency shaping) | Good | d = 0.75-1.63 | Techniques: easy onset, light contact, prolonged speech, pausing/phrasing |
| Stuttering modification (Van Riper) | Moderate | d = 0.56-0.65 | Cancellations, pull-outs, preparatory sets; learn to stutter more easily vs. eliminate |
| MIST (ACT + speech modification) | Promising | Moderate to very large | 10hrs over 4 sessions; significant reduction in stuttering impact at 6 & 12 months; improved communication confidence, reduced avoidance, better quality of life (Sønsterud et al., 2020) |
| fACTS (fluency training + ACT) | Promising | — | 8 sessions by SLPs; significant improvements in self-efficacy, psychosocial functioning, psychological flexibility, and stuttering frequency; gains held at 3 & 6 month follow-ups (Hart et al., 2024) |
| CBT for social anxiety in stuttering | Good | — | Online CBT (iGlebe) improves anxiety, self-efficacy, quality of life; works as supplement to speech therapy (Menzies et al., 2019) |
| Altered auditory feedback (DAF/FAF) | Mixed | — | Some studies show 60-80% reduction; others show no significant effect; highly variable individual response; NOT recommended as sole treatment |

## Pharmacological

| Practice | Evidence Level | Effect Size | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Newer antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone) | Limited | — | Better tolerability; NOT recommended as sole treatment |

## Not Recommended

- Rhythmic speaking
- Breathing regulation as sole treatment
- Hypnosis
- Eclectic unspecified therapies

## App-Specific Evidence Caveats

- **No robust clinical validation** exists for AI-based automated stuttering assessment
- Apps like Stamurai and Stutter Stars exist but have **limited peer-reviewed evidence** for clinical effectiveness
- Most evidence comes from **in-person or telehealth delivery**, not standalone apps
- Gamification and community support are reasonable engagement strategies but lack stuttering-specific evidence
- Individualized treatment tailored to each person's needs is critical (Sønsterud et al., 2020)

## Onboarding Notes

- During onboarding, ask user's **age group** to tailor which practices are shown
- Present evidence levels honestly — don't oversell weak evidence
- For preschool parents: emphasize Lidcombe Program and early intervention urgency
- For adults: acknowledge psychosocial impact upfront — "For adults, stuttering can be associated with substantial psychosocial morbidity including social anxiety and low quality of life" (Perez & Stoeckle, 2016). This validates the user's experience before introducing techniques.
- For adults: highlight integrated approaches (fluency + ACT) as modern best practice
- Always clarify the app supplements but does not replace professional SLP guidance
- Show evidence citations behind every technique (core differentiator per [app-inspiration.md](app-inspiration.md))
